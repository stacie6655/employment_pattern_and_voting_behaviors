# employment_pattern_and_voting_behaviors
This is a data analysis project that digs into where government workers live and work across America, and how that might connect to how people vote.
## What does it do
The project combines employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics with voting records to map out government employment patterns across U.S. metro areas from 1990 to 2018. It's essentially asking: where are all the military personnel and federal employees concentrated, and has this changed over time?
## The Problems
The trickiest part was wrangling 8 different government datasets that weren't designed to work together. The older files (1990-2000) use different formats than the newer ones, and civilian employment data only covers major metro areas while military data includes smaller towns too. There's also the oddity that Washington D.C. shows up in one dataset but not others.
## What the numbers reveal
Some places are heavily military - Jacksonville, NC is about 88% military employment, making it essentially a military town. Others like Susanville, CA are dominated by civilian government jobs (likely the federal prison there).
The geographic patterns have shifted over the decades. Military hotspots from the 1990s like Hilton Head have given way to places like Fort Drum, NY. This probably reflects base closures, new facilities, and changing military priorities.
## The bigger picture
This kind of analysis helps explain why certain communities might vote differently - when your local economy depends heavily on government employment, that shapes political perspectives. The project sets up the groundwork to explore whether areas with more federal workers tend to vote differently than places with more military personnel or private sector employment.
